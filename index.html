      I was part of the University Team with Mishcon de Reya at the online courts.
      We as a team built a website designed to help guide people along divorces (I know, its an exiting topic) using the UK Goverment Web prototype template.
    We were unsuccessful and did not get to the final round, though we did get a mention in the <a href="https://www.lawgazette.co.uk/practice/online-courts-society-victorious-at-legal-geek-hackathon/5061837.article"> Law Gazzet. </a>
    <br />
    I have been asked to be part of the College of Law's <a href="https://globallegalhackathon.com">Global Legal Hack.</a>
    <br/>
    <br />
    Due to licencing of the template, I cannot link to the website on here, but on request I can get access.
